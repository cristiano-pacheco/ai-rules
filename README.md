# AI Rules

This repository contains a collection of rules and guidelines designed to help AI coding assistants generate high-quality, consistent, and idiomatic code across various languages and frameworks.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a structured set of instructions that define best practices for various aspects of software development. While the initial focus is on **Golang**, the repository will expand to cover other languages and technologies.

Current rules cover:

- **Domain Modeling**: Rules for defining domain models and value objects.
- **Architecture**: Guidelines for repositories, services, use cases, and handlers.
- **Frameworks**: Specific rules for using frameworks like Fiber.
- **Testing**: Standards for writing unit tests.
- **General**: Best practices for caching, enums, and validation.

These rules are intended to be used as context for AI models to ensure generated code adheres to specific project standards and architectural patterns.
