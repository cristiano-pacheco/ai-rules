# AI Rules

This repository contains a collection of rules, guidelines, and workflows designed to help AI coding assistants generate high-quality, consistent, and idiomatic code across various languages and frameworks.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a structured set of instructions that define best practices for various aspects of software development. While the initial focus is on **Golang**, the repository will expand to cover other languages and technologies.

## Components

### Rules
Located in language-specific directories (e.g., `golang/`), these define coding standards:

- **Domain Modeling**: Rules for defining domain models and value objects.
- **Architecture**: Guidelines for repositories, services, use cases, and handlers.
- **Frameworks**: Specific rules for using frameworks like Fiber.
- **Testing**: Standards for writing unit tests.
- **General**: Best practices for caching, enums, and validation.

### Commands
Located in `commands/`, these are specific instructions for the AI to execute structured workflows:

- **Create PRD** (`create-prd.md`): Workflow for gathering requirements and generating a Product Requirements Document.
- **Create Tech Spec** (`create-techspec.md`): Workflow for analyzing requirements and designing technical solutions.
- **Create Tasks** (`create-tasks.md`): Workflow for breaking down a Tech Spec into actionable development tasks.
- **Execute Task** (`execute-task.md`): Guidelines for implementing a specific task.

### Templates
Located in `templates/`, these provide the standard format for documents generated by the commands:

- **PRD Template** (`prd-template.md`): Standard format for requirements.
- **Tech Spec Template** (`tech-spec-template.md`): Standard format for technical designs.
- **Task Templates** (`tasks-template.md`, `task-template.md`): Standard formats for task lists and individual task definitions.

These resources are intended to be used as context for AI models to ensure generated code and documentation adhere to specific project standards and architectural patterns.
