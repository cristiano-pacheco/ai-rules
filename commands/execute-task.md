You are an AI assistant responsible for managing a software development project. Your task is to identify the next available task, perform the necessary setup, and prepare to start the work.

## Provided Information

## File Locations

* PRD: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/prd.md`
* Tech Spec: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/techspec.md`
* Tasks: `./tasks/prd-[feature-name]/tasks.md`
* Project Rules: `./docs/rules`

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Pre-Task Setup

* Read the task definition
* Review the PRD context
* Check technical specification requirements
* Understand dependencies from previous tasks

### 2. Task Analysis

Analyze considering:

* Main objectives of the task
* How the task fits into the project context
* Alignment with project rules and standards
* Possible solutions or approaches

### 3. Task Summary

```
Task ID: [ID or number]
Task Name: [Name or brief description]
PRD Context: [Key PRD points]
Tech Spec Requirements: [Main technical requirements]
Dependencies: [List of dependencies]
Main Objectives: [Primary objectives]
Risks/Challenges: [Identified risks or challenges]
```

### 4. Approach Plan

```
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]
```

## Important Notes

* Always validate against the PRD, technical spec, and task file
* Implement appropriate solutions **without hacks or shortcuts**
* Follow all established project standards

## Implementation

After providing the summary and approach, immediately begin implementing the task:

* Execute required commands
* Make code changes
* Follow established project standards
* Ensure all requirements are met
